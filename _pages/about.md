<p align="justify">
I have pursued Master Degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Middle East Technical University under supervision of Prof. Dr. İlkay Ulusoy. At the same time, I have worked as research engineer at Aselsan. I am interested in subject of few-shot segmentation and video action recognition. My aim is to develop deep learning models that can be generalized with less supervision, less prone to forgetting what they learned previously, and be capable of identifying what it does not know.
