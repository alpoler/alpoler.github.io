<p align="justify">
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Riverside, under the supervision of Assistant Professor Vishwanath Saragadam. My research focuses on implicit neural representations and low-level video processing. I aim to develop learnable, compact vision models capable of accurately extracting comprehensive information from noisy, incomplete, or sparse measurements.

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned a Master’s degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Middle East Technical University, where I was supervised by Professor Dr. İlkay Ulusoy. My master’s research centered on designing deep learning models that generalize effectively with limited supervision, exhibit resilience to catastrophic forgetting, and identify their limitations.
